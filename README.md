This project presents a deep learning approach for ECG-based heart disease detection using the PTB-XL dataset. The methodology includes preprocessing 12-lead ECG signals, extracting QRS complex features, and implementing a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Initially, the model was trained for binary classification, achieving an accuracy of 85.19% in differentiating between normal and abnormal ECG signals. The system was then extended to perform multiclass classification across five diagnostic categories: Normal, Myocardial Infarction, ST/T Changes, Conduction Disorders, and Hypertrophy. The multiclass ensemble model reached a test accuracy of 51.76%. These results demonstrate the potential of deep learning for scalable and accurate ECG diagnostics. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khyeh0719/ptb-xl-dataset
